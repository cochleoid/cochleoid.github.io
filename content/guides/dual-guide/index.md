## **Part 1: Setting Up Your Polk State College Account**

1. First, make an account and then an application for dual enrollment at [this link](https://passport.polk.edu/Genesis/student/applogon.jsp). You only need to fill the required fields. Do not stress acceptance; you’ll get in if you’re not a criminal.
2. You will first get acceptance emails, and then you should receive an email telling you your application has been processed (this will take a few days, just be patient). The latter should contain your Polk State ID and Passport password.
3. After getting your Polk ID, watch these [orientation videos](https://www.polk.edu/admission-aid/admissionsteps/student-orientation/) and pass the quiz at the end.

## **Part 2: Choosing and Adding Courses**

- The database of open classes is at: [Class Search](https://polk-prod-pxes02.banner.elluciancloud.com:8090/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/termSelection?mode=search).  
  “Open/Available Classes” should be on by default. Search for the course(s) you want. Note down the **course number** and the **reference number** of each course (boxed in red below), you will need them later.
- Click on the magnifying glass to check for prerequisites (see Part 4: Skipping Prerequisite Courses).
- The **course number** refers to the specific course taught, while the **reference number** lets your counselor know which specific teacher and time you want it.

### Steps:

1. Go into **Focus K-12** and open the three-lined menu. There is an option for “Delta Dual Enrollment.”
2. Provide your contact information in “Contact Info.” This makes some communications easier.
3. Click **“Course Requests.”**  
   - Add **“Polk State College”** as your college.  
   - Choose the term (timeframe) you want.  
   - Select your guidance counselor.
4. Fill out the agreements. Your guardian will have to agree to some as well, in the **Focus K-12 Parent Portal**.
5. After finishing the agreements, add your **Polk State ID** at the top of the screen.
6. Click **“Add a course”** and provide the code/title.  
   - Marking it as optional or required doesn’t make a difference.  
   - After the course shows up in the list, add the **reference number** you got earlier.
7. When done adding your courses, **email your guidance counselor** asking them to approve your courses.  
   - They will email the college advisor to request their approval.  
   - When both approvals are received, move on to **Part 3: Accessing Canva**.

## **Part 3: Accessing Canvas**

- **Canvas** is basically the college version of Schoology.  
  You can access it here: [Canvas Login](http://canvas.polk.edu/login/saml/121)
- You may not know it, but you have a **Polk State College email**.  
  - You can find it by checking your old acceptance emails—it will be CC’ed.  
  - The password to this account is your **Polk State ID followed by “@polk”**.  
  - Log in using this email and password.

## **Part 4: Skipping Prerequisite Courses (Optional)**

Some courses have **ELA or Math requisites** (for other requisites, you’re going to have to take them).

- You can skip these **ELA/Math requisites** by taking **PERT ELA/Writing** and/or **PERT Math**, respectively.  
- See **Polk State Prerequisites** in the parent folder.
