## Step-by-Step Guide to Writing an E-mail  
*By Adrian Hernandez Vega, IB 2027*

Don’t wanna be the guy shamed on the board for their atrocious email? Follow these simple steps.

---

### Part 1: Greeting

- The simplest way to start an e-mail is with a greeting like **“Good morning,”**, **“Good afternoon,”**, or **“Good evening,”**.
- You can choose to address the recipient by name (e.g., *“Good afternoon Mrs. Devore,”*) — or just keep it simple (*“Good evening,”*).
- Add a paragraph break after your greeting.

---

### Part 2: Body

- **Be concise!** Aim to explain your request in **2–3 sentences**, while sounding polite.
- If your message is longer (maybe 10% of the time), you can use multiple paragraphs, but:
  - Keep each paragraph **short and clear** (2–3 sentences).
  - Use **paragraph breaks** to separate ideas.
- Place your main request or question at the end, or on its own line, so it stands out to the reader.

### Part 3: Closer

You have a few choices for how to end your message — each with a slightly different tone:

| Closer        | When to Use It                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Respectfully,** | General-purpose; good when your message may sound demanding. |
| **Sincerely,**    | When your email is more emotional or heartfelt.   |
| **Thank you,**    | When expressing gratitude or after asking a favor. |

- After the closer (with a comma), add a line break, then write your full name.
- If you’re emailing a teacher you don’t know well, include your class period on a new line.
