## About Me

I’m Adrian, a chess player and coach. I’ve gone from complete beginner (300 ELO…) to 2200 in just two years, and I want to help others do the same.

From years of giving mathematics lectures and bootcamps, I have developed great patience and compassion for my students. I bring over the same skills that make my students ace their state assessments to the world of chess. As a bilingual coach, I'm able to teach a wider range of students, whether it be my 4 year old student in Colombia or the senior at my local chess club.

I specialize in young learners (ages 4–14) and new adult learners. My services include: personalized tactical themes and motifs homework, working together to build a practical repertoire for their rating range, tourney preparation for scholastic players, and bilingual lessons in English or Spanish.

## Experience

- Currently hold the title of *Arena International Master*.
- 300+ hours of experience teaching elementary to high school students.  
- Have taught multiple students across North and South America, some of whom saw an ELO increase of 600+ points.  
- Over 30,000 games of experience combined on all major chess platforms (Chess, Lichess, etc).
