# Special Factorizations

## Difference of Squares

**Theorem:**  
An expression of the form \( a^2 - b^2 \) can be factored into  
\( (a + b)(a - b) \).

**Proof:**  
\[
\begin{aligned}
(a + b)(a - b) &= a^2 + ab - ab - b^2 \\
&= a^2 - b^2
\end{aligned}
\]

**Exercise 1:** Calculate the following without a calculator: \( 2024^2 - 2023^2 \).  
**Exercise 2:** Calculate the following without a calculator: \( \frac{2024^2 - 1012^2}{1012} \).

## Sum of Cubes

**Theorem:**  
An expression of the form \( a^3 + b^3 \) can be factored into  
\( (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \).

**Exercise 3:** Factor the following completely: \( x^3 + 1 \).  
**Exercise 4:** Express in simplest form:  
\( \frac{9x^2 - 4y^2}{27x^3 + 8y^3} \)

## Difference of Cubes

**Theorem:**  
An expression of the form \( a^3 - b^3 \) can be factored into  
\( (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \).

**Exercise 5:** Factor the following completely: \( x^3 - 1 \).  
**Exercise 6:** If \( a \) and \( b \) have a difference of 8, and the difference of their cubes is 32, what is the value of \( a^2 + ab + b^2 \)?

## Review

**Exercise 7:** Factor completely: \( (8x^3 - 27y^3)(8x^3 + 27y^3) \)  
**Exercise 8:** Factor completely: \( 32x^6 - 729 \)  
**Exercise 9:** If \( a + b = 7 \) and \( a^3 + b^3 = 42 \), what is the value of the sum \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \)?

**Exercise 10:** If \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers such that \( a + b = 1 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 = 2 \), what is the value of \( a^3 + b^3 \)?

**Exercise 11:** What is the value of  
\[
\frac{2013^3 - 2 \cdot 2013^2 \cdot 2014 - 3 \cdot 2013 \cdot 2014^2 - 2014^3 + 1}{2013 \cdot 2014}
\]

**Exercise 12:** If \( (a - \frac{1}{a})^2 = 4 \), what is the absolute value of \( a^3 - \frac{1}{a^3} \)?
