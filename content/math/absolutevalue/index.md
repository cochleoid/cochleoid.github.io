## Absolute Value Equations

### Getting a Desired Form

First we have to make sure our equation is in the form \( |ax+b| = c \). If we have something such as

\[
2|5x+2|+4 = 18
\]

we must first simplify:

\[
\begin{aligned}
2|5x+2|+4 &= 18 \\
2|5x+2| &= 14 \\
|5x+2| &= 7
\end{aligned}
\]

### Solving for Both Cases

We break down the previous equation into two cases: the positive and negative. This is because the absolute value function always makes our input positive, erasing any trace of its old sign. The left side could be equal to 7 or -7, as the absolute value of either is 7.

**Positive case:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
|5x+2| &= 7 \\
5x+2 &= 7 \\
x &= 1
\end{aligned}
\]

Solution: \( x = 1 \)

**Negative case:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
|5x+2| &= 7 \\
5x+2 &= -7 \\
x &= \frac{-9}{5}
\end{aligned}
\]

 Solution: \( x = \frac{-9}{5} \)

It is good practice to substitute solutions back into the equation, as sometimes extraneous solutions form, as we’ll see below.

### Extraneous Solutions

Try solving the equation:

\[
|1x + 2| = -3
\]

You might find:

- Case 1: \( x = -5 \)
- Case 2: \( x = 1 \)

But when you substitute either one, you get:

\[
3 = -3 \quad \text{ false!}
\]

 Both are **extraneous solutions**. This is because the equation is set equal to a negative, which is impossible with absolute value. Sometimes this negative can sneak its way into a problem, so it's good practice to **always check** your solutions.
