Since the angles formed are equal, connecting the endpoints would create a regular polygon. To graph this figure, we must find an expression for the vertices.\nThis comes down to solving \\( x^n=1 \\) generally. Consider the fact that all points are distributed across a circle of \\( 2\\pi \\) radians. If there are \\( n \\) points, then each one must be \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{n} \\) radians away from each other. To then rotate each point into position, utilize the \\( \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta \\) function:\n\\[ (x_k, y_k) = \\left( r \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right), r \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) \\right) \\] Figure 1: Distinct polygons formed for different values of n\nApothem and Side Length # The apothem is defined as the length from the center of the shape to the midpoint of a side. Since all the apothems are equal, it suffices to compute just one apothem. Begin by splitting the polygon into \\( n \\) equal isosceles triangles. Then, divide each into two triangles with angles of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\). Constructing these triangles would allow us to find both the apothem and polygon side length using trigonometric ratios.\nFigure 2: A polygon is a composition of triangles. We can then split the polygon again to create workable right triangles\nFigure 3: Extract a triangle for trigonometric analysis\nApplying basic trigonometric ratios:\n\\[ \\boxed{r\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = a},\\quad \\boxed{\\ell = 2r\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\]The perimeter is then that side length multiplied by \\( n \\):\n\\[ \\boxed{P=n\\ell=2nr\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Computing the Area # The classical formula for polygon area is \\( \\frac{Pa}{2} \\). Since both the perimeter and apothem length have been found, it is now possible to find the total area of the discrete-sided polygon. Plugging in the known perimeter and apothem length, the area is \\( A=nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\). And by using the trigonometric identity \\( 2\\sin x \\cos x = \\sin(2x) \\), the expression can be turned into:\n\\[ \\boxed{A = \\frac{1}{2}nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Transition Polygons # For regular polygons, the vertices are equally spaced on the unit circle. However, before using the same coordinate form, we must confirm the rotational structure is preserved. Even if each vertex must be a fraction of a turn, the form can be expressed as:\n\\[ x_k=re^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}} \\]Using Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula, which states \\( e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta \\), the form above becomes:\n\\[ x_k=r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right), \\quad y_k=r\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\]Interpolation does not change the structure, so the form is valid. After confirming the form, to find the area enclosed by the interpolated vertices, apply Gauss\u0026rsquo;s area formula.\nTheorem (Gauss\u0026rsquo;s Area Formula):\nGiven a polygon formed by points \\( (x_i,y_i) \\), the area is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_{i}\\right| \\]Substituting \\( x_k = r \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\) and \\( y_k = r \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\), we compute:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{n} r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) \\right| \\]Using the sine subtraction identity \\( \\sin(A - B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B \\), each term simplifies as:\n\\[ r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) = r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Since this term is constant for all \\( k \\), the sum reduces to:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| n r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} nr^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Interestingly, the area formula is the same regardless of whether the polygon is regular or irregular.\nTransition Sample: Triangle to Square # Figure 4: Triangle to square transition phases\nExtending to Three Dimensions # Implementation # For regular polyhedrons of Schl√§fli symbol \\( \\{p,q\\} \\), we extend planar root-of-unity constructions to 3D through rotational symmetry.

The variables are defined as follows: \\( a \\) is the starting amount, \\( b \\) is the common ratio, and \\( x \\) can be the amount of intervals passed, such as years or steps. Since any number (with a few undefined exceptions) raised to the power of 0 is 1, \\( a \\) is also the y-intercept of the function.\nExponential Growth # Suppose a new car goes up in value by 15% every year. The car was bought for $10,000. For a growth rate, we add the percentage of growth to 1. Since the function is increasing by 15% every year, we add 0.15 to 1. We can construct the function:\n\\( f(x)=10,000(1.15^x) \\),\nwhere \\( x \\) is the time passed in years.\nPlugging in 1 for \\( x \\), we can conclude that in 1 year, the car will be worth $11,500. Note that we could have also gotten our answer by repeatedly multiplying by 1.15, revealing the reason for exponentiation in this problem.\nExponential Decay # Now suppose we buy another car for $15,000. It will go under heavy usage. The car will now depreciate. In this example, the value of the car will go down by 20% every year. When the value or amount of something depreciates/decays, we subtract the rate from 1. We will have to subtract 0.20 from 1. This information leads to the function:\n\\( f(x)=15,000(0.80^x) \\)\nSubstituting 1 for \\( x \\), we find that, in 1 year, the car will be worth $12,000.\nExercises # Exercise 1: What is the function rule in the following sequence: 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001\u0026hellip;?

To commence, a third of the beakers were assigned a pH of 1.5 (synthesized via direct application of Sodium Bisulfate); another third, 4.5 (synthesized via dilution); and the last third, 7.5 (the unaltered pH of tap-water). The beakers were placed in pairs inside a digital thermostatic water bath, to be assessed at three different temperatures (25¬∞C, 37¬∞C, and 49¬∞C) each new round; then, one pill was submerged in each beaker, and the final dissolution time (minutes) and final purity level (ppm) were recorded. There were 18 different data points in total: (Gelatin, 1.5pH, 25¬∞C, 10 minutes), for example. Several trends were present in the data. The Tablet representations were always hastier than their Gelatin counterparts; as acidity increased, the final time decreased, as anion concentration was being altered; as temperature increased, the final time decreased, due to the endothermic net reaction. Evidenced by the corollaries in ending purity, the Gelatin Tablets make up for their relative sluggishness with their vigor, as Advil Tablets operate on the body\u0026rsquo;s system \u0026ldquo;all-at-once,\u0026rdquo; while Gelatin Coats operate more thoroughly. The conclusions were corroborated by the monotonic features of the bivariate exponential regressions generated from the data points: i.e., in the regressions, whenever the pH axis increased, the Time axis decreased.\nQuestion # How does the acidity and temperature of a liquid affect the dissolution of medications such as Advil and its variants?\nHypothesis # As acidity increases, the medications will dissolve faster. In similar fashion, the warmer a liquid, the quicker the medications will dissolve.\nMaterial and Uses # Advil Gel-Coated Pills (x9) Advil Tablets (x9) 125mL Beakers (x18) Nitrile Glove Pair (x2) Spreadsheet ‚Äì Efficient data logging Digital Thermostatic Water Bath ‚Äì To freely control temperature Sodium Bisulfate \\( \\text{(NaHSO‚ÇÑ)} \\) ‚Äì To synthesize acids Thermometer ‚Äì To verify temperatures TDS Meter ‚Äì To define dissolution \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; pH Meter ‚Äì To verify acidification levels Procedure # Prepare 18 beakers with 125 mL of tap-water.

Dilute 6 of these until their pH reaches 4.5; verify with pH meter. Record the purity levels of all 18 beakers. Fill the thermostatic water bath and set it to 25¬∞C; verify temperature.

Instead, the function has an oblique (slanted) asymptote of the form \\( y = mx + b \\). To find it, divide the numerator by the denominator and ignore the remainder. For example, \\( j(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x + 4} \\) simplifies to \\( x - 2 + \\frac{9}{x + 4} \\), so the oblique asymptote is \\( y = x - 2 \\).\nExercise 7: Where is the oblique asymptote of the function \\( Y(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} \\)?\nExercise 8: The oblique asymptote of \\( Q(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 9x + 2}{x + 6} \\) is of the form \\( y = Ax + T \\). The vertical asymptote is \\( x = K \\). What is the value of \\( (A + T + K)^2 \\)?\nHoles # When a rational function has a factor that cancels in both the numerator and denominator, a hole occurs. For example, \\( \\frac{(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \\frac{1}{x+2} \\), but \\( x = -1 \\) is still a point of discontinuity. So while the simplified expression looks like \\( \\frac{1}{x+2} \\), the graph must show a hole at \\( x = -1 \\).\nExercise 9: Find the hole(s) of \\( \\frac{(x+2)(x+5)}{3(x+2)} \\)\nExercise 10: Find the hole(s) of \\( \\frac{(2x^2 + 4x + 2)(4x + 8)}{(2x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 4)} \\)\nMixed Practice # Exercise 11: The horizontal and vertical asymptotes of \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 4x + 4}{x^2 + 2x + 1} \\) intersect at a single point \\( (P_1, P_2) \\).

If the horizontal asymptote of \\( a(x) \\) is moved up by \\( K^2 \\), what is the new asymptote?\nExercise 13: The oblique asymptote of \\( c(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 6x + 9}{x + 8} \\) is of the form \\( y = mx + b \\). A line \\( \\ell \\), perpendicular to this asymptote, passes through \\( (0, 3) \\). What is the sum of \\( \\ell \\)\u0026rsquo;s slope and y-intercept?\nExercise 14: The equations \\( Z(x) = \\frac{x^5 + 5x + 5}{x^5 + 5} \\) and \\( I(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 2x + L} + L \\) have the same horizontal asymptote. Where is the hole of \\( I(x) \\)?\nExercise 15: Let \\( V(x) = \\frac{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + \\cdots + x + 1}{x^{80} + x^{79} + \\cdots + x + 1} \\). To the nearest hundredth, what is the value of \\( V(80) \\)?\nExercise 16: Line A is defined by the vertical asymptote of \\( R(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2x + 2}{x + 2} \\). Line B is the oblique asymptote of \\( R(x) \\). Line C is the horizontal asymptote of \\( \\frac{1}{R(x)} \\). What is the area of the triangle bounded by lines A, B, and C?\nCredits # All explanations and problems written by Adrian Hernandez Vega, unless otherwise noted.\nPrefer video?
