Since the angles formed are equal, connecting the endpoints would create a regular polygon. To graph this figure, we must find an expression for the vertices.\nThis comes down to solving \\( x^n=1 \\) generally. Consider the fact that all points are distributed across a circle of \\( 2\\pi \\) radians. If there are \\( n \\) points, then each one must be \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{n} \\) radians away from each other. To then rotate each point into position, utilize the \\( \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta \\) function:\n\\[ (x_k, y_k) = \\left( r \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right), r \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) \\right) \\] Figure 1: Distinct polygons formed for different values of n\nApothem and Side Length # The apothem is defined as the length from the center of the shape to the midpoint of a side. Since all the apothems are equal, it suffices to compute just one apothem. Begin by splitting the polygon into \\( n \\) equal isosceles triangles. Then, divide each into two triangles with angles of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\). Constructing these triangles would allow us to find both the apothem and polygon side length using trigonometric ratios.\nFigure 2: A polygon is a composition of triangles. We can then split the polygon again to create workable right triangles\nFigure 3: Extract a triangle for trigonometric analysis\nApplying basic trigonometric ratios:\n\\[ \\boxed{r\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = a},\\quad \\boxed{\\ell = 2r\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\]The perimeter is then that side length multiplied by \\( n \\):\n\\[ \\boxed{P=n\\ell=2nr\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Computing the Area # The classical formula for polygon area is \\( \\frac{Pa}{2} \\). Since both the perimeter and apothem length have been found, it is now possible to find the total area of the discrete-sided polygon. Plugging in the known perimeter and apothem length, the area is \\( A=nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\). And by using the trigonometric identity \\( 2\\sin x \\cos x = \\sin(2x) \\), the expression can be turned into:\n\\[ \\boxed{A = \\frac{1}{2}nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Transition Polygons # For regular polygons, the vertices are equally spaced on the unit circle. However, before using the same coordinate form, we must confirm the rotational structure is preserved. Even if each vertex must be a fraction of a turn, the form can be expressed as:\n\\[ x_k=re^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}} \\]Using Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula, which states \\( e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta \\), the form above becomes:\n\\[ x_k=r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right), \\quad y_k=r\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\]Interpolation does not change the structure, so the form is valid. After confirming the form, to find the area enclosed by the interpolated vertices, apply Gauss\u0026rsquo;s area formula.\nTheorem (Gauss\u0026rsquo;s Area Formula):\nGiven a polygon formed by points \\( (x_i,y_i) \\), the area is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_{i}\\right| \\]Substituting \\( x_k = r \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\) and \\( y_k = r \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\), we compute:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{n} r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) \\right| \\]Using the sine subtraction identity \\( \\sin(A - B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B \\), each term simplifies as:\n\\[ r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) = r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Since this term is constant for all \\( k \\), the sum reduces to:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| n r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} nr^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Interestingly, the area formula is the same regardless of whether the polygon is regular or irregular.\nTransition Sample: Triangle to Square # Figure 4: Triangle to square transition phases\nExtending to Three Dimensions # Implementation # For regular polyhedrons of Schl√§fli symbol \\( \\{p,q\\} \\), we extend planar root-of-unity constructions to 3D through rotational symmetry.

The variables are defined as follows: \\( a \\) is the starting amount, \\( b \\) is the common ratio, and \\( x \\) can be the amount of intervals passed, such as years or steps. Since any number (with a few undefined exceptions) raised to the power of 0 is 1, \\( a \\) is also the y-intercept of the function.\nExponential Growth # Suppose a new car goes up in value by 15% every year. The car was bought for $10,000. For a growth rate, we add the percentage of growth to 1. Since the function is increasing by 15% every year, we add 0.15 to 1. We can construct the function:\n\\( f(x)=10,000(1.15^x) \\),\nwhere \\( x \\) is the time passed in years.\nPlugging in 1 for \\( x \\), we can conclude that in 1 year, the car will be worth $11,500. Note that we could have also gotten our answer by repeatedly multiplying by 1.15, revealing the reason for exponentiation in this problem.\nExponential Decay # Now suppose we buy another car for $15,000. It will go under heavy usage. The car will now depreciate. In this example, the value of the car will go down by 20% every year. When the value or amount of something depreciates/decays, we subtract the rate from 1. We will have to subtract 0.20 from 1. This information leads to the function:\n\\( f(x)=15,000(0.80^x) \\)\nSubstituting 1 for \\( x \\), we find that, in 1 year, the car will be worth $12,000.\nExercises # Exercise 1: What is the function rule in the following sequence: 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001\u0026hellip;?

Follow these simple steps.\nPart 1: Greeting # The simplest way to start an e-mail is with a greeting like ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood afternoon,‚Äù, or ‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù. You can choose to address the recipient by name (e.g., ‚ÄúGood afternoon Mrs. Devore,‚Äù) ‚Äî or just keep it simple (‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù). Add a paragraph break after your greeting. Part 2: Body # Be concise! Aim to explain your request in 2‚Äì3 sentences, while sounding polite. If your message is longer (maybe 10% of the time), you can use multiple paragraphs, but: Keep each paragraph short and clear (2‚Äì3 sentences). Use paragraph breaks to separate ideas. Place your main request or question at the end, or on its own line, so it stands out to the reader. Part 3: Closer # You have a few choices for how to end your message ‚Äî each with a slightly different tone:\nCloser When to Use It Respectfully, General-purpose; good when your message may sound demanding. Sincerely, When your email is more emotional or heartfelt. Thank you, When expressing gratitude or after asking a favor. After the closer (with a comma), add a line break, then write your full name. If you‚Äôre emailing a teacher you don‚Äôt know well, include your class period on a new line.

To commence, a third of the beakers were assigned a pH of 1.5 (synthesized via direct application of Sodium Bisulfate); another third, 4.5 (synthesized via dilution); and the last third, 7.5 (the unaltered pH of tap-water). The beakers were placed in pairs inside a digital thermostatic water bath, to be assessed at three different temperatures (25¬∞C, 37¬∞C, and 49¬∞C) each new round; then, one pill was submerged in each beaker, and the final dissolution time (minutes) and final purity level (ppm) were recorded. There were 18 different data points in total: (Gelatin, 1.5pH, 25¬∞C, 10 minutes), for example. Several trends were present in the data. The Tablet representations were always hastier than their Gelatin counterparts; as acidity increased, the final time decreased, as anion concentration was being altered; as temperature increased, the final time decreased, due to the endothermic net reaction. Evidenced by the corollaries in ending purity, the Gelatin Tablets make up for their relative sluggishness with their vigor, as Advil Tablets operate on the body\u0026rsquo;s system \u0026ldquo;all-at-once,\u0026rdquo; while Gelatin Coats operate more thoroughly. The conclusions were corroborated by the monotonic features of the bivariate exponential regressions generated from the data points: i.e., in the regressions, whenever the pH axis increased, the Time axis decreased.\nQuestion # How does the acidity and temperature of a liquid affect the dissolution of medications such as Advil and its variants?\nHypothesis # As acidity increases, the medications will dissolve faster. In similar fashion, the warmer a liquid, the quicker the medications will dissolve.\nMaterial and Uses # Advil Gel-Coated Pills (x9) Advil Tablets (x9) 125mL Beakers (x18) Nitrile Glove Pair (x2) Spreadsheet ‚Äì Efficient data logging Digital Thermostatic Water Bath ‚Äì To freely control temperature Sodium Bisulfate \\( \\text{(NaHSO‚ÇÑ)} \\) ‚Äì To synthesize acids Thermometer ‚Äì To verify temperatures TDS Meter ‚Äì To define dissolution \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; pH Meter ‚Äì To verify acidification levels Procedure # Prepare 18 beakers with 125 mL of tap-water. Label them as Tablet 1‚Äì9 and Gelatin 1‚Äì9. Add 4g of \\( \\text{NaHSO‚ÇÑ} \\) to 12 beakers (6 Tablet, 6 Gelatin) and stir to reach pH 1.5. Dilute 6 of these until their pH reaches 4.5; verify with pH meter. Record the purity levels of all 18 beakers. Fill the thermostatic water bath and set it to 25¬∞C; verify temperature. Place a Tablet and Gelatin pair (same pH) into the bath. Drop 1 Tablet and 1 Gelatin in their respective beakers and start timing. Record dissolution time and final purity when each dissolves. Repeat for other Tablet-Gelatin pairs at 25¬∞C. Repeat Steps 5‚Äì9 for 37¬∞C and 49¬∞C.

Gelatin times vary more, suggesting inconsistency. Dissolution time decreases as temperature or acidity increases. Stomach conditions (37¬∞C, pH 1.5) yield realistic times: ~20min for Tablets, ~34min for Gelatin. Statistical Analysis # Presentation Average Median IQR Std. Dev.

For creating a general regression, a bit of math is to be expected. We have to investigate the effect \\( X \\) (Temperature) and \\( Y \\) (pH) have on \\( Z \\) (Time). Two regressions were generated: one for Tablets, and one for Gelatin.\nMultiregressional Matrix Equation:\n[ \\begin{bmatrix} n \u0026amp; \\sum x_i \u0026amp; \\sum y_i \\ \\sum x_i \u0026amp; \\sum x_i^2 \u0026amp; \\sum x_iy_i \\ \\sum y_i \u0026amp; \\sum x_iy_i \u0026amp; \\sum y_i^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\ln(a) \\ \\ln(b) \\ \\ln(c) \\end{bmatrix} # \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum \\ln(z_i) \\ \\sum x_i\\ln(z_i) \\ \\sum y_i\\ln(z_i) \\end{bmatrix} ]\nSubstituting and solving yields:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} z_T \u0026\\approx 22.3 \\cdot (0.971)^x \\cdot (1.12)^y \\\\ z_G \u0026\\approx 1590 \\cdot (0.898)^x \\cdot (1.28)^y \\end{aligned} \\] Conclusions # The dissolution process was endothermic; higher temperature sped it up. More acidic solutions dissolved pills faster by affecting anion concentration. Realistic simulation of stomach conditions confirms product behavior. Purity (ppm) was a useful metric to define \u0026ldquo;fully dissolved.\u0026rdquo; Tablets are best for quick relief; Gelatin offers a slower, more thorough release. The relationship between \\( \\text{NaHSO‚ÇÑ} \\) and pH appeared linear.
