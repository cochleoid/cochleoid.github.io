Loading initial ramdisk… error: you need to load the kernel first. Were the grave words the GRUB spoke to me, the same way a paramedic informs a family member of the patient’s critical condition. In this story, however, there was no CPR or even any chest compressions… just a Live OS and some patience.\nInitial instinct was to boot up an old GParted disk drive to chroot into the system.

Let’s head over to the Kubuntu terminal to make our first incisions.\nThe patient comes wheeling in on the stretcher as I mount my Btrfs drive:\nkubuntu@kubuntu:~$ sudo mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=5,rw /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt kubuntu@kubuntu:~$ sudo umount /mnt kubuntu@kubuntu:~$ sudo mount -t btrfs -o subvol=@,rw /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt Remember, if your drive’s blood type isn’t Btrfs, you can mount without the extra fuss. Remembering the wisdom of Ted, we perform the blood transfusion to bind the directories:\nkubuntu@kubuntu:~$ for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /sys/firmware/efi/efivars /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done An electric shock followed by a mandatory neofetch reveals signs of life!

Let’s cover some important points you should keep in mind, many of which I use in combination to choose my courses. When analyzing a college’s official website, look out for these:\nSyllabus and Work # It’s important to keep every syllabus intact, in case a registrar employee wants to review how similar your course was. Nowadays, this shouldn’t be difficult, as most syllabi are just a few clicks away in a Canvas or Blackboard page.\nIf you don’t already have sample material from your coursework, you should look back in the LMS archives or reach out to your professor.\nInstitutional Credit Limits # Most colleges and universities set a limit on how many incoming credits you can transfer, which could be from AP exams, CLEP exams, or dual enrollment.\nA common transfer limit for incoming freshmen I’ve seen is 45 credit hours: about 15 courses.\nIf transfer credits are a priority, watch your credit counts to make sure all can come through safely.\nCredits for Your Major # If a credit is related to your major, you may want to consider retaking the course in college for a deeper understanding. This is common in health majors, where the skipped courses are bound to sneak up on you later down the line (looking at you, MCAT).\nSome institutions will outright reject your credits if they’re mandatory requirements for your major, so it’s important to read policy carefully.\nReaching Out # And for the safest way to check if a credit would transfer: sending a quick email!\nIt doesn’t need to be Shakespeare-tier, just a concise, brief question.\nTake the below as inspiration:\nGood afternoon, X Institution Registrar, I hope you are doing well. I was wondering: would the Y (course code and name) credit from Z Institution transfer as part of a dual enrollment program? Thank you for your time in advance. Best, Your Name School, Class of 2048 Overlap # A few months ago you finished your Calculus BC exam and scored a 5 (Pretty nice, right?). But then you ask to transfer a Calculus II credit from your friendly community college.\nThe registrar employee gives you a confused look, for these are the same credit! You shouldn’t check only how your dual enrollments would transfer, but also the related AP exams you might’ve taken.\nTransferology # Thankfully, many universities and colleges have begun putting their transfer policies on the Transferology website, a page where you can input your coursework and exams to see how they’d carry over.\nLet’s see how this would work with the previous Calculus example:\nAfter inputting our MAC2312 course from the Add Courses option and the AP Calculus BC exam from the Standardized Exams subsection, we can see that these credits would indeed overlap at the University of Florida.\nConclusion # Ultimately, your goal should be to keep evidence of your previous coursework, keep credits organized through a transfer spreadsheet, and reach out to make sure your hard work isn’t put to waste. Credit transfer policies are prone to change, so you should never assume your C+ in 1995 College Composition will transfer.\n","date":"2 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/academics/dual-transfer/","section":"Academics","summary":"","title":"Transferability of Dual Enrollment Courses","type":"academics"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dwm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dwm","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/screenshot/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Screenshot","type":"tags"},{"content":" Introduction # I personally use dwm by suckless as my window manager of choice for its sheer simplicity.

But wait again… how was the screenshot below even taken?\nFinding Source # Let’s head to the source code to try to solve this mystery. Head over to your build directory, which in my case was /usr/src/dwm/ and open our config file where the commands are. Goodness, what does any of the below mean!\n/* commands */ static char dmenumon[2] = \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;; /* component of dmenucmd, manipulated in spawn() */ static const char *dmenucmd[] = { \u0026#34;dmenu_run\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-m\u0026#34;, dmenumon, \u0026#34;-fn\u0026#34;, dmenufont, \u0026#34;-nb\u0026#34;, col_gray1, \u0026#34;-nf\u0026#34;, col_gray3, \u0026#34;-sb\u0026#34;, col_cyan, \u0026#34;-sf\u0026#34;, col_gray4, NULL }; static const char *lichess[] = { \u0026#34;/usr/bin/librewolf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--new-window\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lichess.org\u0026#34;, NULL }; static const Key keys[] = { /* modifier key function argument */ { MODKEY, XK_p, spawn, {.v = dmenucmd } }, { MODKEY|ShiftMask, XK_Return, spawn, {.v = termcmd } }, We’re looking dead straight at an array in C. Looking at the basic format, we can see that for every “key,” there’s an associated keybind and argument. As we will see below, an argument is simply the binary or command being run. If we need a screenshot command, we will have to choose a worthy screenshotting application first.\nScrot! # For screenshotting, I suggest the modular Scrot binary for most people. It does exactly what you need to do, with a variety of parameters that could save screenshots to whichever directory you may need (~/Pictures comes to mind…)\nFor those new to package browsing (or too lazy, if I were the reader): I’ve provided the install commands for the major distros. Sorry, Hannah Montana Linux, maybe next time.\nUbuntu/Debian\nsudo apt-get install scrot Arch-Based\nsudo pacman -S scrot Fedora\nsudo yum install scrot OpenSUSE\nsudo zypper install scrot Adding Scrot to Commands # Now that you’ve actually got a screenshotting utility installed, let’s look at how we can add it into the array.\nFor the commands section, we’re gonna need the binary and some parameters. Scrot is pretty handy in that it’s got loads of options with how you want the screenshot to come out. As for me, I like to select a region to screenshot (the “-s” parameter), and having that screenshot directly funneled into the home directory:\nstatic const char *scrot[] = { \u0026#34;scrot\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-s\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Screenshot.png\u0026#34;, NULL }; For those who want a dedicated folder, you can tack it on to the directory. If you prefer a whole-screen capture or if you want a separate command for it, you can make this quick change:\nstatic const char *scrot[] = { \u0026#34;scrot\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Screenshot.png\u0026#34;, NULL }; Adding a Keybind # Fast forward a bit to the keybind section, we can finally add the keyboard shortcut to call Scrot. We can simply append the below, where MODKEY|ShiftMask and XK_s would imply the shortcut ALT+SHIFT+S.\n{ MODKEY|ShiftMask, XK_s, spawn, {.v = scrot } }, Bonus: Piping into OCR # As a cool bonus, we can also pipe Scrot into an OCR tool to get immediate OCR scans into our clipboard after selecting an on-screen region. We can write a quick bash file titled ocrcapture for this task in /usr/bin:\n#!/bin/bash scrot -s /tmp/ocr.png tesseract /tmp/ocr.png stdout | xclip -selection clipboard rm -f /tmp/ocr.png And of course, here is the dwm config implementation:\nstatic const char *ocrcapture[] = { \u0026#34;/usr/bin/ocrcapture\u0026#34;, NULL }; { MODKEY|ShiftMask, XK_y, spawn, {.v = ocrcapture } }, Conclusion # In this brief tutorial, we enabled screenshotting and OCR scanning in dwm through just a few keyboard clicks (and a little bash). Imagine my satisfaction being able to add in screenshotting to the dwm keybinds after months of just manually typing in the scrot commands in CLI each time. I hope that same satisfaction is one I can lend to you.\n","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/systems/dwm-scrot/","section":"Systems","summary":"","title":"Screenshotting in DWM with Scrot (and OCR with Tesseract)","type":"systems"},{"content":"","date":"30 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/integration/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Integration","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/math/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Math","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/math/","section":"Maths","summary":"","title":"Maths","type":"math"},{"content":"","date":"30 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/substitution/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Substitution","type":"tags"},{"content":" Tangent Substitution in Integration # We are going to cover one of the main three types of trigonometric substitution.\nYou might be asking: why do we need trig for this?\nAfter all, this looks like just a rational expression:\n\\[ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2 + 16} \\, dx \\]And you’d be right: tt is rational indeed.

Since the angles formed are equal, connecting the endpoints would create a regular polygon. To graph this figure, we must find an expression for the vertices.\nThis comes down to solving \\( x^n=1 \\) generally. Consider the fact that all points are distributed across a circle of \\( 2\\pi \\) radians. If there are \\( n \\) points, then each one must be \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{n} \\) radians away from each other. To then rotate each point into position, utilize the \\( \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta \\) function:\n\\[ (x_k, y_k) = \\left( r \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right), r \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) \\right) \\] Figure 1: Distinct polygons formed for different values of n\nApothem and Side Length # The apothem is defined as the length from the center of the shape to the midpoint of a side. Since all the apothems are equal, it suffices to compute just one apothem. Begin by splitting the polygon into \\( n \\) equal isosceles triangles. Then, divide each into two triangles with angles of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\). Constructing these triangles would allow us to find both the apothem and polygon side length using trigonometric ratios.\nFigure 2: A polygon is a composition of triangles. We can then split the polygon again to create workable right triangles\nFigure 3: Extract a triangle for trigonometric analysis\nApplying basic trigonometric ratios:\n\\[ \\boxed{r\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = a},\\quad \\boxed{\\ell = 2r\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\]The perimeter is then that side length multiplied by \\( n \\):\n\\[ \\boxed{P=n\\ell=2nr\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Computing the Area # The classical formula for polygon area is \\( \\frac{Pa}{2} \\). Since both the perimeter and apothem length have been found, it is now possible to find the total area of the discrete-sided polygon. Plugging in the known perimeter and apothem length, the area is \\( A=nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\). And by using the trigonometric identity \\( 2\\sin x \\cos x = \\sin(2x) \\), the expression can be turned into:\n\\[ \\boxed{A = \\frac{1}{2}nr^2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)} \\] Transition Polygons # For regular polygons, the vertices are equally spaced on the unit circle. However, before using the same coordinate form, we must confirm the rotational structure is preserved. Even if each vertex must be a fraction of a turn, the form can be expressed as:\n\\[ x_k=re^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}} \\]Using Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula, which states \\( e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta \\), the form above becomes:\n\\[ x_k=r\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right), \\quad y_k=r\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\]Interpolation does not change the structure, so the form is valid. After confirming the form, to find the area enclosed by the interpolated vertices, apply Gauss\u0026rsquo;s area formula.\nTheorem (Gauss\u0026rsquo;s Area Formula):\nGiven a polygon formed by points \\( (x_i,y_i) \\), the area is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_{i}\\right| \\]Substituting \\( x_k = r \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\) and \\( y_k = r \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\), we compute:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{n} r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) \\right| \\]Using the sine subtraction identity \\( \\sin(A - B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B \\), each term simplifies as:\n\\[ r^2 \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) - \\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right) \\right) = r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Since this term is constant for all \\( k \\), the sum reduces to:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| n r^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} nr^2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\]Interestingly, the area formula is the same regardless of whether the polygon is regular or irregular.\nTransition Sample: Triangle to Square # Figure 4: Triangle to square transition phases\nExtending to Three Dimensions # Implementation # For regular polyhedrons of Schläfli symbol \\( \\{p,q\\} \\), we extend planar root-of-unity constructions to 3D through rotational symmetry.

The variables are defined as follows: \\( a \\) is the starting amount, \\( b \\) is the common ratio, and \\( x \\) can be the amount of intervals passed, such as years or steps. Since any number (with a few undefined exceptions) raised to the power of 0 is 1, \\( a \\) is also the y-intercept of the function.\nExponential Growth # Suppose a new car goes up in value by 15% every year. The car was bought for $10,000. For a growth rate, we add the percentage of growth to 1. Since the function is increasing by 15% every year, we add 0.15 to 1. We can construct the function:\n\\( f(x)=10,000(1.15^x) \\),\nwhere \\( x \\) is the time passed in years.\nPlugging in 1 for \\( x \\), we can conclude that in 1 year, the car will be worth $11,500. Note that we could have also gotten our answer by repeatedly multiplying by 1.15, revealing the reason for exponentiation in this problem.\nExponential Decay # Now suppose we buy another car for $15,000. It will go under heavy usage. The car will now depreciate. In this example, the value of the car will go down by 20% every year. When the value or amount of something depreciates/decays, we subtract the rate from 1. We will have to subtract 0.20 from 1. This information leads to the function:\n\\( f(x)=15,000(0.80^x) \\)\nSubstituting 1 for \\( x \\), we find that, in 1 year, the car will be worth $12,000.\nExercises # Exercise 1: What is the function rule in the following sequence: 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001\u0026hellip;?

Your bank gives you two options on interest: they can either give you $10,000 every day for a month, or alternatively, they can double your savings every day for a week. Which option would yield more, and by how much? Exercise 4: A function in the form \\( f(x)=a(b^x) \\) satisfies \\( f(1)=2 \\), \\( f(3)=8 \\), and \\( f(5)=32 \\). What is the value of \\( a+b \\)? Exercise 5: Which of these will grow the fastest: \\( f(x)=3x \\), \\( f(x)=x^3 \\), or \\( f(x)=3^x \\)? Exercise 6: At a growth rate of 1% every year, how long will it take for a city\u0026rsquo;s population to double? Exercise 7: What is the product of the solutions to \\( 2^x=2x \\)?

The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent in the function; in this example, the degrees are 2 and 3, respectively. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term with the highest exponent; here, they are 5 and 4.\nVertical Asymptotes # Division by zero is undefined. In the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x+2}{x+1} \\), the denominator is zero when \\( x = -1 \\), which makes the expression undefined. So, \\( x = -1 \\) is a vertical asymptote. To find vertical asymptotes, set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). These values represent lines that the function approaches but never touches.\nExercise 1: Where is the vertical asymptote of the function \\( r(x) = \\frac{x+5}{x^2 + 2x + 1} \\)?\nExercise 2: Where is the vertical asymptote of the function \\( a(x) = \\frac{3x + 3(x+7)^9 + \\pi}{x^3 + x^2 + x} \\)?\nHorizontal/Oblique Asymptotes # Bottom-Heavy Degree # A bottom-heavy rational function is one where the denominator\u0026rsquo;s degree is greater than the numerator\u0026rsquo;s. For example, \\( h(x) = \\frac{5x^2 + 7}{4x^3 + 2x} \\) has a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 0 \\). This is because as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), the denominator grows faster, and the function tends toward zero. If a constant is added after the rational function, the horizontal asymptote shifts. For example, \\( h(x) = \\frac{5x^2 + 7}{4x^3 + 2x} + 3 \\) has a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 3 \\).\nExercise 3: Where is the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( s(x) = \\frac{x^4 + x^3}{x^9 + 9} \\)?\nExercise 4: Where is the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( b(x) = \\frac{x^5 + 5}{x^6 + 6} + 7 \\)?\nEqual Degree # When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. For example, \\( A(x) = \\frac{7x + 5}{8x + 2} \\) has a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = \\frac{7}{8} \\).\nExercise 5: Where is the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( F(x) = \\frac{(1+2+3+4)x^5 + 6}{(1-2-3-4)x^5 - 6} \\)?\nExercise 6: Where is the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( p(x) = \\frac{\\pi x^3}{\\pi x^3 + \\pi} + \\pi \\)?\nTop-Heavy Degree # If the numerator\u0026rsquo;s degree is higher than the denominator\u0026rsquo;s, there is no horizontal asymptote. Instead, the function has an oblique (slanted) asymptote of the form \\( y = mx + b \\). To find it, divide the numerator by the denominator and ignore the remainder. For example, \\( j(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x + 4} \\) simplifies to \\( x - 2 + \\frac{9}{x + 4} \\), so the oblique asymptote is \\( y = x - 2 \\).\nExercise 7: Where is the oblique asymptote of the function \\( Y(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} \\)?\nExercise 8: The oblique asymptote of \\( Q(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 9x + 2}{x + 6} \\) is of the form \\( y = Ax + T \\). The vertical asymptote is \\( x = K \\). What is the value of \\( (A + T + K)^2 \\)?\nHoles # When a rational function has a factor that cancels in both the numerator and denominator, a hole occurs. For example, \\( \\frac{(x+1)}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \\frac{1}{x+2} \\), but \\( x = -1 \\) is still a point of discontinuity. So while the simplified expression looks like \\( \\frac{1}{x+2} \\), the graph must show a hole at \\( x = -1 \\).\nExercise 9: Find the hole(s) of \\( \\frac{(x+2)(x+5)}{3(x+2)} \\)\nExercise 10: Find the hole(s) of \\( \\frac{(2x^2 + 4x + 2)(4x + 8)}{(2x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 4)} \\)\nMixed Practice # Exercise 11: The horizontal and vertical asymptotes of \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 4x + 4}{x^2 + 2x + 1} \\) intersect at a single point \\( (P_1, P_2) \\). What is \\( P_1 + P_2 \\)?\nExercise 12: The functions \\( a(x) = \\frac{6x^7 + 8x + 3}{3x^2 - 27} \\) and \\( b(x) = \\frac{x^3 + 2x + 5}{3x^2 - K} \\) have the same vertical asymptote. If the horizontal asymptote of \\( a(x) \\) is moved up by \\( K^2 \\), what is the new asymptote?\nExercise 13: The oblique asymptote of \\( c(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 6x + 9}{x + 8} \\) is of the form \\( y = mx + b \\). A line \\( \\ell \\), perpendicular to this asymptote, passes through \\( (0, 3) \\). What is the sum of \\( \\ell \\)\u0026rsquo;s slope and y-intercept?\nExercise 14: The equations \\( Z(x) = \\frac{x^5 + 5x + 5}{x^5 + 5} \\) and \\( I(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 2x + L} + L \\) have the same horizontal asymptote. Where is the hole of \\( I(x) \\)?\nExercise 15: Let \\( V(x) = \\frac{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + \\cdots + x + 1}{x^{80} + x^{79} + \\cdots + x + 1} \\). To the nearest hundredth, what is the value of \\( V(80) \\)?\nExercise 16: Line A is defined by the vertical asymptote of \\( R(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 2x + 2}{x + 2} \\). Line B is the oblique asymptote of \\( R(x) \\). Line C is the horizontal asymptote of \\( \\frac{1}{R(x)} \\).

The circumference of a circle is the length around a circle: the perimeter of a circle. A chord is a line that connects any two points on a circle\u0026rsquo;s circumference. The diameter of a circle is a chord that passes through the center of a circle; it is double the radius.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s pi? # The strange looking symbol, \\( \\pi \\), is pi! The famous constant is the ratio of a circle\u0026rsquo;s circumference to its diameter. This means that given a circle\u0026rsquo;s diameter, we can find its circumference (essentially its perimeter) by multiplying its diameter by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.14). The area bounded by a circle is equal to \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\nArc Measure and Arc Length # Arc measure concerns the measure of an arc\u0026rsquo;s central angle, while arc length concerns arcs\u0026rsquo; length. Arcs, such as \u0026ldquo;major arc \\( \\overset{\\frown}{AHV} \\)\u0026rdquo; are portions of the circumference of a circle. Arcs are denoted by the points they pass through, and it is also specified whether an arc is major or minor, as it will tell you whether to look for the smaller or larger arc.\nSee the circle below for a circle with radius of 2 and a central angle of \\( 90^\\degree \\). Since the radius is 2, the diameter is 4, which means the circumference of the full circle is \\( 4\\pi \\). To find the length of the arc highlighted, we divide the central angle by \\( 360^\\degree \\) to find the portion occupied. Since \\( \\frac{90}{360} = \\frac{1}{4} \\), this means that the arc takes up a quarter of the full circumference, \\( 4\\pi \\), so the arc length is \\( \\pi \\). Notice that if we know arc length, we can find arc measure, and vice versa.\nInscribed Angles and Inscribed Shapes # Inscribed angles sound more difficult than they actually are. The general process consists of multiplying or dividing by 2: an inscribed angle\u0026rsquo;s measure is half of the central angle\u0026rsquo;s measure. Look at the diagram below. The measure of \\( \\angle AHV \\) is half of \\( \\angle AOV \\)\u0026rsquo;s measure.\nIn a cyclic quadrilateral (a four-sided shape in a circle), angles that are diagonal to each other are supplementary. This means that \\( \\angle E + \\angle V = 180^\\degree \\) and that \\( \\angle K + \\angle H = 180^\\degree \\).\nWhen the hypotenuse of a triangle coincides with the diameter, we can assume that the triangle is a right triangle. The converse also holds true.\nTangent Lines # When taken in the most literal sense, to be tangent means to touch. A tangent line touches a circle at a point, shown below. A tangent line will always be perpendicular to the radius.\nEquation of a Circle # The equation for a circle centered at \\( (h,k) \\) with a radius of \\( r \\) is\n\\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\]When written in that form, it is in standard form, where finding the center and radius isn\u0026rsquo;t difficult. However, sometimes a circle is written in expanded form, where every binomial is expanded. Expanded form is undesirable for finding the important details. To convert to standard form, we must \u0026ldquo;complete the square.\u0026rdquo; This is best shown with an example.\nConsider the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 - 14x - 12y + 76 = 0 \\). First, we must move all constants to the right side:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 - 14x - 12y = -76 \\]Then, rearrange to group \\( x \\) terms and \\( y \\) terms:\n\\[ (x^2 - 14x) + (y^2 - 12y) = -76 \\]We will first complete the square for \\( x \\) and treat the group as a quadratic. The \u0026ldquo;perfect square constant\u0026rdquo; for a quadratic of form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is equal to \\( \\left( \\frac{b}{2} \\right)^2 \\). Add this constant to both sides:\n\\[ (x^2 - 14x + (-7)^2) + (y^2 - 12y) = -76 + (-7)^2 \\]\\[ (x^2 - 14x + 49) + (y^2 - 12y) = -27 \\]Now the \\( x \\) terms can be factored into a perfect square: \\( \\left( x + \\frac{b}{2} \\right)^2 \\):\n\\[ (x + \\frac{-14}{2})^2 + (y^2 - 12y) = -27 \\]\\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y^2 - 12y) = -27 \\]Repeat the previous steps for \\( y \\):\n\\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = -27 + 36 \\]\\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = 9 \\]\\[ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 9 \\]The circle is now in standard form. Now it is easy to see that the circle is centered at \\( (7,6) \\) and that the circle has a radius of 3. In summary, we find and add the perfect square constant, and then factor.\nExercises # Adrian wants to know the area of his clock. He only knows that the minute hand is 8 inches long and extends fully to the minute it points at. In square inches, what is the area of the clock? Adrian\u0026rsquo;s sister is an archer.

To commence, a third of the beakers were assigned a pH of 1.5 (synthesized via direct application of Sodium Bisulfate); another third, 4.5 (synthesized via dilution); and the last third, 7.5 (the unaltered pH of tap-water). The beakers were placed in pairs inside a digital thermostatic water bath, to be assessed at three different temperatures (25°C, 37°C, and 49°C) each new round; then, one pill was submerged in each beaker, and the final dissolution time (minutes) and final purity level (ppm) were recorded. There were 18 different data points in total: (Gelatin, 1.5pH, 25°C, 10 minutes), for example. Several trends were present in the data. The Tablet representations were always hastier than their Gelatin counterparts; as acidity increased, the final time decreased, as anion concentration was being altered; as temperature increased, the final time decreased, due to the endothermic net reaction. Evidenced by the corollaries in ending purity, the Gelatin Tablets make up for their relative sluggishness with their vigor, as Advil Tablets operate on the body\u0026rsquo;s system \u0026ldquo;all-at-once,\u0026rdquo; while Gelatin Coats operate more thoroughly. The conclusions were corroborated by the monotonic features of the bivariate exponential regressions generated from the data points: i.e., in the regressions, whenever the pH axis increased, the Time axis decreased.\nQuestion # How does the acidity and temperature of a liquid affect the dissolution of medications such as Advil and its variants?\nHypothesis # As acidity increases, the medications will dissolve faster. In similar fashion, the warmer a liquid, the quicker the medications will dissolve.\nMaterial and Uses # Advil Gel-Coated Pills (x9) Advil Tablets (x9) 125mL Beakers (x18) Nitrile Glove Pair (x2) Spreadsheet – Efficient data logging Digital Thermostatic Water Bath – To freely control temperature Sodium Bisulfate \\( \\text{(NaHSO₄)} \\) – To synthesize acids Thermometer – To verify temperatures TDS Meter – To define dissolution \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; pH Meter – To verify acidification levels Procedure # Prepare 18 beakers with 125 mL of tap-water. Label them as Tablet 1–9 and Gelatin 1–9. Add 4g of \\( \\text{NaHSO₄} \\) to 12 beakers (6 Tablet, 6 Gelatin) and stir to reach pH 1.5. Dilute 6 of these until their pH reaches 4.5; verify with pH meter. Record the purity levels of all 18 beakers. Fill the thermostatic water bath and set it to 25°C; verify temperature. Place a Tablet and Gelatin pair (same pH) into the bath. Drop 1 Tablet and 1 Gelatin in their respective beakers and start timing. Record dissolution time and final purity when each dissolves. Repeat for other Tablet-Gelatin pairs at 25°C. Repeat Steps 5–9 for 37°C and 49°C.

Gelatin times vary more, suggesting inconsistency. Dissolution time decreases as temperature or acidity increases. Stomach conditions (37°C, pH 1.5) yield realistic times: ~20min for Tablets, ~34min for Gelatin. Statistical Analysis # Presentation Average Median IQR Std. Dev. Tablet (n=9) 14 minutes 15 minutes 11 minutes 15 minutes Gelatin (n=9) 3h 14m 42 minutes 4h 9m 4h 17m Both (n=18) 1h 44m 25 minutes 27 minutes 3h 19m Regressional Analysis # From the data points obtained, the presence of bivariate exponential patterns was noticed. For creating a general regression, a bit of math is to be expected. We have to investigate the effect \\( X \\) (Temperature) and \\( Y \\) (pH) have on \\( Z \\) (Time). Two regressions were generated: one for Tablets, and one for Gelatin.\nMultiregressional Matrix Equation:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} n \u0026 \\sum x_i \u0026 \\sum y_i \\\\ \\sum x_i \u0026 \\sum x_i^2 \u0026 \\sum x_iy_i \\\\ \\sum y_i \u0026 \\sum x_iy_i \u0026 \\sum y_i^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\ln(a) \\\\ \\ln(b) \\\\ \\ln(c) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\\[=\\begin{bmatrix} \\sum \\ln(z_i) \\\\ \\sum x_i\\ln(z_i) \\\\ \\sum y_i\\ln(z_i) \\end{bmatrix} \\]Substituting and solving yields:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} z_T \u0026\\approx 22.3 \\cdot (0.971)^x \\cdot (1.12)^y \\\\ z_G \u0026\\approx 1590 \\cdot (0.898)^x \\cdot (1.28)^y \\end{aligned} \\] Conclusions # The dissolution process was endothermic; higher temperature sped it up. More acidic solutions dissolved pills faster by affecting anion concentration. Realistic simulation of stomach conditions confirms product behavior. Purity (ppm) was a useful metric to define \u0026ldquo;fully dissolved.\u0026rdquo; Tablets are best for quick relief; Gelatin offers a slower, more thorough release. The relationship between \\( \\text{NaHSO₄} \\) and pH appeared linear.
